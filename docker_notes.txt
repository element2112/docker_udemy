docker notes:

- docker containers are not vms


vms:
- hardware -> host os -> hyper visor (vmware) -> Guest OS -> bins/libs -> application

docker:
- hardware -> host os -> docker daemon -> (bins/libs) -> application

- docker is kind of a package manager for entire applications (kind of)

- images do not change state. Are built once unless there are changes

- containers == running image
	- OOP example
		- image -> class
		- container -> instance of class
		
- containers are immutable
	- for ex: 
		- running ubuntu image, create a file, exit container
		- run image again, file no longer exists. Therefore container is not changed

- in casual convo docker image and docker repository used interchangably
	- a docker repo consists of multiple images with the same name
		- different versions
		
- docker hub like github for docker images
	- can have personal private or public docker images

- only use images apart of the official repositories managed by docker


BUILDING DOCKER IMAGES

two ways:
	- run docker container -> make changes -> docker commit (saves to new image layer) [wont use this in real world]
	
	- docker file (recipe for creating docker image)
		(think package.json for npm)


CREATE DOCKER file

	- all docker files start with FROM
	- FROM baseimage (use an official base image if possible)
		- FROM scratch ... (an image with no base os)

BUIILDING DOCKER FILE
	- "-t name" allows us to reference the image by what he choose instead of the hash
	
	" docker image build -t web1:1.0 . " (setting version to 1.0)
	
	"docker image ls" (lists all images on our docker host)
	
	"docker image rm web1:1.0" (remove an image)
	
	"docker image tag web1 bs009/web1:latest" (pushing to docker hub)
	
	"docker image rm -f c1b3" (delete an image -f is force. first four characters of image ID)
	
	"docker pull bs009/web1:latest" (pulling image from docker hub)
	

RUNNING IMAGE
 "docker container ls" (showing all running containers)
 
 "docker container run -it -p 5000:5000 -e FLASK_APP=app.py web1"
 
 "docker container ls -a" (see all stopped containers)
 
 "docker container rm condescending_darwin" (remove docker container. its good to not leave a bunch of stopped containers in docker host)
 
 "docker container run -it --rm --name web1container -p 5000:5000 -e FLASK_APP=app.py -d web1" (removes container after it's finished and gives custom name)
 
 "docker container logs -f web1container" (see logs of a container running in background)
 
 "docker container stats" (real time metrics about container)
 
 "docker container run -it --name web1container3 -p 5000 -e FLASK_APP=app.py -d --restart on-failure web1" (running another instance. When only specifying one port, docker auto binds to random port from host)
 
 "docker container stop web1container" (stop docker container)
 
-it : allowing docker to enable various linux symbols (like ctrl+c to kill a process, makes terminal interactive)

-p : port ->> bind_port_on_docker_host:bind_port_within_docker_container

-e : environment variable

-d : runs container in background

-f : tails logs in real time
